			<p>Every company likes to think of their project as &ldquo;the big game,&rdquo; but only one can truly lay claim to THE Super Bowl. While NBC Sports already had massive numbers of fans on Facebook and Twitter, they were looking to conquer another social media platform in the lead-up to the game: Tumblr. The network needed something eye-catching and beautiful that was also rock solid, fast, and responsive across desktop and tablet platforms in order to share content and interact with fans.</p>
			<p>To recreate the sparkling on-air trophy graphics and branding, we combined JavaScript particle effects, SVG objects, and CSS animations into a unique, smooth, and compelling animation that would just work everywhere (even on underpowered tablets and devices). Next, we developed a fully custom responsive grid and lightbox interaction to provide the best possible visual experience for visitors that also allowed for maximum sharing and social exposure. During the game itself, the site was promoted as a &ldquo;second-screen experience,&rdquo; serving up the television ads as they went live &mdash; and we made sure that those videos became the center of attention, presented in a huge and beautiful manner.</p>
			<p>With media coverage on CNN, Huffington Post, Reuters, Variety, AdWeek, and Advertising Age, as well as over 38 million unique page views in under twenty-four hours, the site was an immense success, surpassing every expectation. It was built using Gulp and Sass on the Tumblr backend.</p>
